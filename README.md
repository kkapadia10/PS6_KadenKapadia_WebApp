# PS6_KadenKapadia_WebApp

Here is the shiny link for the web app: https://kkapadia10.shinyapps.io/Used_and_New_Cars/

The dataset being used for this webapp is called Used and New Cars Datasets and can be accessed through the website kaggle.com. The data set was updated by George Baffour. 
The goal of the dataset is to let the user choose their ideal car and to find a car that fits all their requirements. 
The data consists of several variables necessary for buyers to look at before buying cars, such as the Model, Year, Status, Mileage, Price, and MSRP of the car. 
In the plot, the user can select a certain car model and based on that, the plot shows them a comparison of the price vs mileage for all the cars of that model. I am aiming to reveal the trend that as mileage increases, the price value of the car decreases. Additionally, the color options lets the user choose if the data points should be red, orange, green, blue, or purple.
