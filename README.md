Here is the shiny link for the web app: https://kkapadia10.shinyapps.io/Used_and_New_Cars/

The dataset being used for this webapp is called Used and New Cars Datasets and can be accessed through the website kaggle.com. The data set was updated by George Baffour. 
The goal of the dataset is to let the user choose their ideal car and to find a car that fits all their desired requirements. 
The data consists of several variables necessary for buyers to look at before buying cars, such as the Model, Year, Status, Mileage, Price, and MSRP of the car. 
In the Welcome panel, the user gets introduced to background information regarding the dataset. The user also learns the number of car observations and useful variables there are in the dataset. Also, they can see a random sample of 10 car data values from the dataset.
In the plot, the user can select a certain car model and based on that, the plot shows them a comparison of the price vs mileage for all the cars of that model. I am aiming to reveal the trend that as mileage increases, the price value of the car decreases. Additionally, the color options lets the user choose if they want the data points to be red, orange, green, blue, or purple. 
In the table, the user can select a minimum year, and the table will output all the data about the cars that were manufactured later than that specified year. Additionally, the user has the option to select if the table should show 10, 25, 50, or 100 enteries. Also, the user can search for a specifc car to see all the available data about that car.
I worked for about 7 hours on this problem set.
